***VisualCrypt for Windows 10 Universal Platform (UWP) is ready for testing.

To build VisualCrypt.UWP and its dependencies, you need:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Visual Studio 2015, Installation Options: C#, Support for Windows 10 Universal Apps

2. SqLite for Universal App Platform, e.g. V 3.10.2 (Visual Studio Extension)
Later Versions will probably work, too.
   - This may need a C++ Support lib, which can be found in the same directory
     than the SqLite library.

3. Multilingual App Toolkit 3.1.1250 (download installer). 4.0 is not compatible.
